  <h1>A minimal GitHub Pages site (HTML)</h1>
  <p>
  This website is hosted on GitHub Pages with the absolute minimum of configuration (<a href="https://github.com/mfisher87/simple-site-html">view the source</a>).
  <strong>You do not <em>need</em> to know about static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://mystmd.org">MySTMD</a>, <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a> to use GitHub Pages.</strong>
  Because this website is simple HTML, you can deploy it anywhere from the raw repository files, without special configuration.
  </p>

  <h2>Tutorial</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>:
    Set your repository to deploy to GitHub Pages from the "main" (default) branch.
    From your GitHub repository, navigate to "Settings" at the top navigation bar.
    Then, select "Pages" from the left sidebar menu.
    Finally, configure your build and deployment source to "Deploy from a branch", select the "main" branch", and leave the folder set to "/ (root)".
    Click "Save".

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>:
    Create HTML (and optionally CSS &amp; JavaScript) content in your repository in an <code>index.html</code> file, which will become the landing page of your GitHub pages site.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point, you should have a functional site! :tada:
    The URL of your site can be viewed by clicking the "Edit repository details" button, which is shown as a cog or gear icon (:gear:).
    Within this menu, select "Use your GitHub Pages website", and click "Save changes".
  </p>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>
    Sites that contain a lot of repetitive content may be better served by using a Static Site Generator.
    It can be very difficult to maintain a large pure HTML website because layout changes may require editing a large number of files.
  </p>

  <h2>Thoughts on Static Site Generators (SSGs)</h2>

  <p>There are _many_ SSGs and which you use can be a matter of preference.</p>

  <p>
    I often reach for <a href="https://quarto.org ">Quarto</a> and recommend it to my colleagues because
    (1) it's aimed at technical publishing and (1a) can execute code cells much like a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> and (1b) has strong citation support;
    (2) content format is very close to pure Markdown and doesn't require learning a templating language;
    (3) it supports basic features any other SSG might support, like blogging.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jekyll has been around for a long time.
    I don't recommend it to my colleagues because it requires at minimum knowing 2 new "languages" (assuming the user is already familiar with and prefers Markdown):
    Liquid, and Jekyll's configuration schema.
    I think of Jekyll as low level web development tool, not as a high-level content publishing tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keep an eye out for <a href="https://mystmd.org/">MySTMD</a>, which uses an superset of Markdown called MyST to provide a stronger foundation for extensions.

  These opinions are <a href="https://mfisher87.github.io">mine</a> alone :)
